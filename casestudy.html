<h3>The Assignment</h3>
<p class="assignment">
    For this assignment, we were tasked to pick a non-profit website that that we believed in but that could also use some help with their website. I was selected to be in a group with Maricela Austgen & Mark Feilberg. We talked about what types of organizations we felt should be more seen and decided that an organization that introduced more women & girls into the tech would would be an awesome cause to help. 
</p>
<p class="assignment">
  After much research, we came across an organization in Omaha, Nebraska that desperately needed our help. They offered free courses in HTML & Javascript to girls as young as 12 years old, FOR FREE! Because of this amazing venture this organization had taken on, we decided they would be our project for the next 3 weeks. 
</p>
<p class="assignment">
  For this project we primarily used, Adobe Xd, Invision, Mire & Google Drive.

<div class="problem">
    <h4 class="whiteText">The Problem</h4>
    <p class="theProblem">Mystery Code Society is a non profit organization based in Omaha, Nebraska. 
        They offer free courses to young girls in order to start to bridge the gender
        gap seen today in the the technology field. However, their website offers a 
        lack of design, poor information architecture and unfriendly usability.

        <p class="originalPara">
            The Mystery Code Society’s original website is very simple. There was a lack of color, small text font and a confusing image as their hero image. 
            We wanted to take their idea of solving a mystery but update their UI and reorganize the information given on their website. 
            We also wanted to promote their free classes and create an easy way for students to sign up for free courses which they offer year around.

  <h3>The Research</h3>
    <ul class="researchList">
      <li class="researchList">4 participants, male and female under the age of 35, were interviewed to gather qualitative data to see how we could improve MCS’s website. 
      </li>
      <li>
        A google questionnaire was conducted of 22 individuals, (73% female) to obtain quantitative data to see if they were aware of the gender gap in tech & what attracts them to an organization’s website.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blind Testing: Prompted users to critque three different websites, including the non-profit website we picked to redesign. Recieved feedback on likes & dislikes. Last question to users was to pick which site they would most like to donate to based upon each organizations website.

  <h4 class="whiteText">The Redesign</h4>
  <p class="theProblem">
    Our solution to the organization’s website is to completely redesign their website. We want to incorporate their passion for teaching young girls about the technology world but in a more modern, upbeat and fun way. They are a young company whose target audience are girls from 5th-12th grade, therefore their website should appeal to young girls who want to learn something new but also have fun!

<div class="sketches">
  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p class="assignment">
      We started by creating quick sketches of what we wanted the new website to look like. Our main goal was to emphasize their free courses but we also wanted to give this site a more feminime touch without it looking too girly. We also wanted to modernize the site and make it more user friendly. In order for girls and their parents to easily navigate the website in order to sign up themselves or their daughters for courses.

<div class="prototype">
  <h3>The Prototype</h3>
  <p class="assignment">
    With sketches and lofi prototypes done, it was time to test. We wanted feedback on the users flow as well as the overall feel of the site. Going with the pink and purple color scheme was risky, but well worth it. Many users responded positively to the colors. We also discovered, through testing that, Sharing/donate buttons should be towards the top of the page,
    example answers for the application questions,
    Success page when user completes application,
    Fit forms onto one page so user doesn’t have to scroll too much
    Space sections out 
    “Join Our Cause” isn’t very clear on what user is signing up for. So
    we took this feedback and iterated our design to have a clear mission and to be user friendly.

  <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
  <p class="assignment">
      Through this process we learned that we were able to improved significantly with each iteration based on the user testing feedback. 
      That Working in a group setting helped from start to finish in the research and design process. And that We all had different skill sets that helped bring our idea to life.
  </p>
  <p class="assignment">
    If we had more time we would have created more screens for the navigation.
    Create volunteer form for desktop, Create screens for current & past student’s projects, Redesign the footer, Reiterate the color scheme
